  about_markdown: |
    Aaron began his career in real estate in 2007, just before the market collapsed, and has soared to the top of the industry. In 2008, Aaron was awarded the "Rookie of the Year" award for outselling his competition by over 2 million dollars in sales.

    In 2011, Aaron was introduced to a national speaker and a mega agent coach, they joined forces and began a Real Estate Expansion Team. Aaron, as the Lead Agent, went on to process over 100 home sales in the first year. By the end of 2017, the team had pended almost 1,000 houses, just that year, and had 170 agents in 90 different locations across the US, under Aaronâ€™s leadership as Director of Expansion.

    Aaron is a Keller Williams MAPS Mastery Coach. He coaches agents across the US and Canada on how to build a business worth owning and having a life by design, not by default.

    Today Aaron is re-tooling the Real Estate Sales Team model through developing RealTour Property Group based in Portland, Oregon. His sales team will deliver a world-class customer experience through consistent communication, while allowing agent partners to build their businesses.
